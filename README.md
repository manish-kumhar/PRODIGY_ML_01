# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model. The model is trained on various features such as living area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, overall quality, year built, and others.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It contains various attributes of houses along with their sale prices. The dataset is stored in a file named `train.csv`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Results

The model is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) metric. Additionally, visualizations of the actual vs. predicted sale prices and feature coefficients are provided.
